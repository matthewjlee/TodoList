# TodoList
another piece of js foundational material

This todo list was built by following Practical JavaScript course on watchandcode.com.
Huge thank you to Gordon Zhu for creating in-depth material that helped me create my first *working* web app.

This todo list is based off the structure/mechanics provided by http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/
(We're using vanillajs because we're using *pure* js)
